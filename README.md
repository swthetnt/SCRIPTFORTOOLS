# Ubuntu Security Tools Installer

## Features
- Safe, error-checked installation
- Verified dependencies
- System compatibility checks
- Comprehensive logging



## Usage
1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:swthetnt/SCRIPTFORTOOLS.git
   cd ubuntu-security-tools



  ## INSTALLATION
sudo ./setup.sh

sudo ./install.sh


**Best Practices:**
1. Keep scripts in separate files for easier maintenance
2. Use explicit version pins for critical tools
3. Include SHA256 checksums for downloaded files
4. Add a `--dry-run` option for testing
5. Include uninstallation script for clean removal

This structure ensures reliability while maintaining system integrity. The scripts can be safely run multiple times and will skip already-installed components.
